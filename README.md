# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

This homework includes 2 files which contains code

1. Juypter Notebook : climate_starter_final.ipynb which contains code for 

    ## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

      ### Precipitation Analysis and
      ### Station Analysis

     
2. app.py which contains the code for the :

    ## Step 2 - Climate App

    Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

    Use Flask to create your routes.

3. Also included are images of the plots from the Juypter Notebook as .jpg in folder Images.

4. Word Document Bonus.doc that answers questions asked in the Bonus Challenge.

I was a bit confused about what was asked for in the climate_start.ipynb notebook, the README.md and sqlalchemy_grading_rubric.pdf. 
So I tried to address and answer all the requirements and questions. I apologise if I seem to have repeated some code and done somethings that were not exactly asked for.
